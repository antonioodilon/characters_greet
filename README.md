Program written in C#. The function that is the most important one takes a Jagged Array of type string of any length as its only argument, and it outputs all the possible combinations of the string elements of the arrays inside it with the string elements of the other arrays in the form of the Console.WriteLine() function calls. Therefore, no individual string element will be combined with either itself or its peers that are inside of the same individual array inside the jagged array. For this program the names of some characters from the Stranger Things series were used.
